Two main reasons: 1. to share materials that might be useful for others, 2. to document some things for myself all in one place.\nResources\nBefore I start, I want to share some of the resources I used.\nAlison Hill and Desirée De Leon’s webinar about Sharing on Short Notice. WATCH THIS before going any further. This is where I was first introduced to netlify and it blew my mind how easy it was to turn my html files into a website.\nThe distill documentation, which also happens to be a … distill website!\nOther people’s distill websites: Ijeamaka Anyene, Shannon Pileggi(aka Piping Hot Data), Miles McBain, and Tom Mock.\nAlison Hill’s website for design inspiration and for content. I think I find a new resource every time I visit her site. For example, check out her talk on Recent updates in the R markdown family.\nAnd more! I’ll try to make note of difference resources I used throughout the blog.\nIf you would like to follow along with the video I created, find it here.\n\n\n\n",
