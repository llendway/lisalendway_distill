I have used R since 2003 (whoa!) in many different roles: student, statistician/data scientist, and teacher. I have always enjoyed teaching people how to use R, but love it even more since the creation of R Markdown. If you are new to R and R Studio, you might find my tutorials from my introductory data science class helpful.\nBack when I worked in industry and got excited about knitting to WordI am also a mom and spouse. I enjoy tending to my jungle garden (thatâ€™s how I fondly refer to my backyard garden) in the summers, cycling outdoors or indoors when necessary, and working on remodeling and restoring our house.\nEducation\nPhD in Statistics University of Minnesota, School of Statistics, 2012\nBA in Mathematics and Spanish Macalester College, 2003\nWork Experience\nVisiting Assistant Professor Macalester College, 2012-2012 & 2017-present\nStatistics and Advanced Analytics Consultant Securian Financial, 2016-2017\nSenior Data Scientist Allina Health / Health Catalyst, 2014-2016\nSenior Biostatistician HealthEast, 2013-2014\nData Analyst Target Corporation, 2003-2006\nContact\nIf you are interested in having me lead a training, feel free to contact me.\n\n\n\n",
