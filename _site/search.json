I have used R since 2003 (whoa!) in many different roles: student, statistician/data scientist, and teacher. I have always enjoyed teaching people how to use R, but love it even more since the creation of R Markdown. If you are new to R and R Studio, you might find my tutorials from my introductory data science class helpful.\n\nA Facebook post from back when I worked in industry and got excited about knitting to Word\nI am also a mom and spouse. I enjoy tending to my jungle garden (that’s how I fondly refer to my backyard garden) in the summers, cycling outdoors or indoors when necessary, and working on remodeling and restoring our house.\n\n\n\nMy familyCross-cycling on a beautiful Minnesota October day!\n\nThe “Jungle Garden”, aka my 3rd child in the summerThe patio Chris and I built summer 2020.\n\n\nEducation\nPhD in Statistics, 2012\nUniversity of Minnesota, School of Statistics\nBA in Mathematics and Spanish, 2003Macalester College\nWork Experience\nVisiting Assistant Professor, 2012-2012 & 2017-present\nMacalester College\nStatistics and Advanced Analytics Consultant, 2016-2017\nSecurian Financial\nSenior Data Scientist, 2014-2016\nAllina Health / Health Catalyst\nSenior Biostatistician\nHealthEast, 2013-2014\nData Analyst, 2003-2006\nTarget Corporation\nContact\nIf you are interested in having me lead a training, feel free to contact me.\n\n\n\n",
