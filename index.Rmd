Professionally, I am a professor of statistics and data science at [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/mscs/) and R Studio certified instructor of tidyverse. I have used R since 2003 (whoa!) in many different roles: student, statistician/data scientist, and teacher. I have always enjoyed teaching people how to use R, but love it even more since the creation of R Markdown. If you are new to R and R Studio, you might find my [tutorials](https://ds112-lendway.netlify.app/) from my introductory data science class helpful.

I am also a mom and spouse. I enjoy tending to my [jungle garden](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/383017143315005418/) (that's how I fondly refer to my backyard garden) in the summers, cycling outdoors or indoors when necessary, and working on remodeling and restoring our house.
