## Why a website?

Well, I finally did it! I made a website. And to celebrate, I'm going to share how I did it. And, why did I do it? Two main reasons: 1. to share materials that might be useful for others, 2. to document some things for myself all in one place. 

## Resources

Before I start, I want to share some of the resources I used.

* Alison Hill and Desir√©e De Leon's [webinar](https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/sharing-on-short-notice-how-to-get-your-materials-online-with-r-markdown/) about Sharing on Short Notice. WATCH THIS before going any further. This is where I was first introduced to [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and it blew my mind how easy it was to turn my html files into a website.    

* The distill [documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/), which also happens to be a ... distill website!

* Other people's distill websites: [Ijeamaka Anyene](https://ijeamaka-anyene.netlify.app/), [Shannon Pileggi](https://www.pipinghotdata.com/about.html)(aka Piping Hot Data), [Miles McBain](https://milesmcbain.xyz/), and [Tom Mock](https://themockup.blog/).

* Alison Hill's [website](https://alison.rbind.io/) for design inspiration and for content. I think I find a new resource every time I visit her site. For example, check out her [talk](https://alison.rbind.io/talk/2020-larug/) on Recent updates in the R markdown family.   
* And more! I'll try to make note of difference resources I used throughout the blog.
